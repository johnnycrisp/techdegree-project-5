// I hiked to the top of the mountain and got this picture of the canyon and trees below. 

// It was amazing to see an iceberg up close, it was so cold but didnâ€™t snow today. 

// The red cliffs were beautiful. It was really hot in the desert but we did a lot of walking through the canyons.

// Fall is coming, I love when the leaves on the trees start to change color.

// I drove past this plantation yesterday, everything is so green!

// My summer vacation to the Oregon Coast. I love the sandy dunes!

// We enjoyed a quiet stroll down this countryside lane.

// Sunset at the coast! The sky turned a lovely shade of orange.

// I did a tour of a cave today and the view of the landscape below was breathtaking.

// I walked through this meadow of bluebells and got a good view of the snow on the mountain before the fog came in.`;
